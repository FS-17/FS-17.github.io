The system utilizes Cascade Classifiers to detect faces within images, crops them, and then employs FaceNet to calculate image embeddings. By comparing these embeddings and applying a similarity threshold, the system determines if two faces belong to the same person. It supports comparing a single face against a database of many faces to identify individuals."
